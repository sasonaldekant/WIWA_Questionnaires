# Lesson Learned: Database & Integration Issues

## 1. Character Encoding (Mojibake)
**Issue**: Inserting text with special characters (e.g., "č", "ć", "ž", "š") into **NVARCHAR** columns using standard **INSERT INTO ... VALUES ('Težina')** resulted in corrupted characters (**TeÅ_ina**).
**Root Cause**: SQL Server treats string literals as non-Unicode (VARCHAR) by default unless prefixed. If the database collation or connection encoding doesn't match, characters are lost.
**Solution**: ALWAYS use the **N** prefix for string literals.

> -- INCORRECT
> INSERT INTO Questions (Text) VALUES ('Težina');
>
> -- CORRECT
> INSERT INTO Questions (Text) VALUES (N'Težina');

## 2. Identity Insert Failures
**Issue**: Attempting to insert explicit IDs into a table with **IDENTITY** property enabled generally fails unless **SET IDENTITY_INSERT TableName ON** is used. However, mistakenly assuming a table *has* identity when it doesn't (or vice versa) leads to confusion.
**Specific Failure**: We missed that **QuestionFormats** has an IDENTITY column, and also missed a non-nullable **Code** column.
**Lesson**:
1. Check table definition (**sp_help** or **INFORMATION_SCHEMA**) before writing custom insert scripts.
2. When inserting configuration/lookup data (like formats), ensure all non-nullable columns are provided.
3. Be explicit with column lists in **INSERT** statements. **INSERT INTO Table DEFAULT VALUES** or **INSERT INTO Table VALUES (...)** is risky. Always use **INSERT INTO Table (Col1, Col2) VALUES (Val1, Val2)**.

## 3. Deployment Script Idempotency
**Issue**: Running scripts multiple times caused partial failures where parent records were deleted but children remained (or formats missing), breaking foreign keys on re-insert.
**Solution**: Always wipe related tables in correct dependency order (Leaf -> Root) before re-populating.

> DELETE FROM LeafTable;
> DELETE FROM MiddleTable;
> DELETE FROM RootTable;

Ensure the script transaction covers the entire reset-and-repopulate cycle if possible, or use defensive checks (**IF NOT EXISTS**).
